# McMSF浆果服服务器

Generated with `create-sjmcl-extension`.

## Scripts

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run bump -- 1.2.3`

## Build

### Entry and Output

`npm run build` creates:

- `dist/mcmsf.hellow/`
- `dist/mcmsf.hellow-<version>.sjmclx`

The bundled frontend is written to `frontend/index.js`, matching `sjmcl.ext.json`.
You can split the implementation across as many local files as you want under `src/`; the build step bundles them into that single runtime entry.
The generated example page uses TSX component trees, so you can start from JSX/TSX immediately instead of staying with manual `React.createElement(...)` calls.

### Build Modes

| Flag | Value | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--mode` | `production`, `development` | `production` | Selects the overall build profile and sets `process.env.NODE_ENV`. `production` enables syntax and whitespace minification for a compact release bundle; `development` keeps the output more readable for inspection and debugging. |
| `--obfuscate` | none or boolean (`true`, `false`, `1`, `0`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`) | on in production, off in development | Controls identifier minification only. It renames local symbols to shorter names, but it does not switch build mode or enable syntax/whitespace minification by itself. |

In short: `--mode` chooses the overall output style, while `--obfuscate` only toggles identifier mangling.

When you pass flags through `npm run`, add `--` before the build flags so npm forwards them to `scripts/build.mjs`:

```bash
npm run build
npm run build -- --mode development
npm run build -- --obfuscate
npm run build -- --obfuscate=off
npm run build -- --mode development --obfuscate=off
```

### Host-Provided Singleton Dependencies

The SJMCL host already provides these dependencies:

| Package | Use Instead |
| --- | --- |
| `react` | `api.React` |
| `@chakra-ui/react` | `api.ChakraUI` |

Direct imports from those packages are rejected at build time.

If a third-party dependency bundles them transitively, the build still succeeds but prints warnings with:

- the bundled singleton package name
- the approximate byte contribution in the final output
- one or more dependency chains from your source file to the bundled package

This makes bundle impact visible without blocking common dependency patterns.

## Project Layout

- `src/index.ts`
  Entry point for your source tree.
- `src/pages/example-page.tsx`
  Example TSX custom page and standalone page component.
- `src/widgets/`
  Home widget components.
- `src/pages/`
  Additional page modules such as the settings page.
- `src/modals/`
  Custom modal components opened from extension actions or UI slots.
- `src/types/host.ts`
  Minimal local typings for the injected SJMCL extension API.

## Notes

- Put optional static files under `assets/`.
- Add an optional `icon.png` at the project root.
- Add optional persistent files under `data/`.
- The build script copies `sjmcl.ext.json`, `icon.png`, `assets/`, and `data/` when present.
